This repository is a practice project that all of it's learning/creating process has covered by [John Smilga](https://www.udemy.com/user/janis-smilga-3/) in this huge [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/in-depth-html-css-course-build-responsive-websites/).\
I specially thank him for teaching me how to learn frontend and getting deep in concepts and he was the best teacher of mine.\
